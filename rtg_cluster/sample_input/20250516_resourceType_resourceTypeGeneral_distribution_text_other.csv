abstract
potato is the most important tuber crop in the world however its highly heterozygous and tetraploid genome is a burden for breedingbased improvement which is reinforced by the lack of haplotyperesolved genome assemblies here we report the 31 gb haplotyperesolved chromosomescale assembly of the tetraploid potato cultivar ovata at a haplotyping accuracy of 996 which was achieved by coupling pacbio long read sequencing hifi 700 singlegamete nuclei sequencing and hic sequencing

this study investigates the genetic underpinnings of three rare congenital disorders donnaibarrow syndrome dbs congenital disorders of glycosylation cdg and c syndrome in the chinese population we employed whole exome sequencing wes to analyze fetuses from three separate families all of which presented significant congenital abnormalities and had no reported family history of genetic diseases 

in the first case we identified two novel variants in the lrp2 gene c11177ga parg3726his and c3114ga in a fetus with exencephaly and brain structural abnormalities indicative of donnaibarrow syndrome these variants were inherited from phenotypically normal parents with each parent contributing one variant functional assays confirmed reduced lrp2 expression at both the rna and protein levels and 3d modeling suggested potential disruptions to protein function

the second case involved a fetus diagnosed with cdg exhibiting cleft lip and palate occult spina bifida and renal abnormalities wes revealed two novel variants in the fcsk gene c655ga pval219met and c13411gc with one variant inherited from each parent subsequent analyses showed decreased fcsk expression and predicted loss of protein functionality due to structural changes

in the third case a fetus presenting with trigonocephaly heart malformation and polydactyly was found to carry a de novo variant in the cd96 gene c382ct pgln128 leading to a truncated protein and significant loss of function 

these findings highlight the utility of wes in identifying novel genetic variants in rare congenital disorders and provide crucial insights into the molecular basis of these conditions our study underscores the importance of genetic screening in early diagnosis and management of such disorders",1

"text","as one of the posttranscriptional regulatory mechanisms uncoupling of transcription and translation plays an essential role in development and adulthood physiology however it remains elusive how thousands of mrnas get translationally silenced while stability is maintained for up to hours or even days before translation  in addition to oocytes and neurons developing spermatids have significant uncoupling of transcription and translation for delayed translation  therefore spermiogenesis represents an excellent in vivo model for investigating the mechanism underlying uncoupled transcription and translation through fulllength polya deep sequencing we discovered dynamic changes in polya length through deadenylation and repolyadenylation deadenylation appeared to be mediated by micrornas mirnas and transcripts with shorter polya tails tend to be sequestered into ribonucleoproteins rnps for translational repression and stabilization in contrast repolyadenylation allows for translocation of the translationally repressed transcripts from rnps to polysomes for translation  overall our data suggest that mirnadependent polya length control represents a novel mechanism underlying uncoupled translation and transcription in haploid male germ cells",1

"text","background diffuse large bcell lymphoma dlbcl is the most common type of aggressive lymphoid malignancy and a highly heterogeneous disease
methods in this study we performed wholegenome and transcriptome sequencing and a genomewide crisprcas9 knockout screen to study an activated bcell like diffuse large bcell lymphoma dlbcl cell line rck8 targeted genes were validated by single gene knockout and inhibitor assays we have furthermore reanalyzed the published crisprcas9 screens from a pancancer study and sets of dlbcl lines
results using a summarizing method optimized to address the complexity introduced by the time course design we identified a distinct pattern of genetic essentialities in rck8 including a dependency on crebbp and mdm2 shown at early time points and a gradually increased dependency on oxidative phosphorylationrelated genes the dependency on crebbp is associated with the corresponding genetic alterations identified in this cell line ie a balanced translocation involving ep300 which results in a truncated form of the protein that lacks the critical bromodomain and the histone acetyltransferase hat domain we further evaluated the previously published crisprcas9 screens and identified a genetic essentiality of the crebbp or ep300 gene in a small set of cancer cell lines including several dlbcl cell lines that are highly sensitive for ep300 knockout and with crebbp mutations or copy number loss the dependency of the remaining hat function in the crebbp andor ep300deficient genotype was validated by testing the hat domain inhibitor a485
conclusions our study suggests that integration of the unbiased functional screen results with genomic and transcriptomic data can identify druggable vulnerability in individual or subgroups of tumours which may help to develop more effective therapeutic strategies for cancers that are genetically highly heterogeneous such as dlbcl",1

"text","background metagenomic highthroughput sequencing mngs represents a powerful tool for detecting nucleic acids from various pathogens such as bacteria fungi viruses and parasites in clinical samples despite its extensively employed in the pathogen diagnosis for various infectious diseases its application in diagnosing strokerelated infection and its potential impact on clinical decisionmaking antiinfection treatment clinical intervention and patient prognosis remain insufficiently explored additionally while mngs offers promising potential it facts limitations related to sensitivity specificity cost and standardization which could influence its integration into routine clinical practice
methods we retrospectively analyzed 18 stroke patients admitted to the first affiliated hospital of medical college of shantou university from january to february 2023 comparing culturebased methods with mngs detection and assessing its significance in etiological diagnosis additionally we evaluated the performance differences among various sequencing platforms
results among the 18 stroke patients enrolled pulmonary infections were identified in 7 cases urinary tract infections in 1 case central nervous system infections in 10 cases and combined pulmonary and central nervous system infections in 2 cases with 2 cases yielding negative results mngs detected pathogens in 13 cases aligning with clinical diagnoses 75 concordance whereas culturebased methods yielded positive results in only 6 cases 22 concordance importantly for 9 of the 18 patients adjustments to antiinfective treatment regimens based on mngs results led to improved symptomatic relief and infection control this suggests that mngs can contribute to more timely and precise treatment modifications particularly for infections with low pathogen loads potentially enhancing clinical outcomes
conclusion our findings highlights the utility of mngs in diagnosing strokeassociated infections by providing a more comprehensive etiological diagnosis compared to traditional method while mngs shows promise in enhancing diagnostic accuracy and guiding clinical treatment it high cost and technical challenges need addressing before widespread clinical adoption future research should focus on optimizing mngs protocols integration it with convertional diagnostic tools and evaluating its costeffectiveness and clinical impact through larger multicentric studies",1

"text","background pneumonia is a common acute respiratory infection that contributes to significant mortality and morbidity worldwide the disruption of the airway microbiome in respiratory infection has been extensively reported however whether the changes in respiratory tract rt microbial communities during pneumonia were related to disease severity remains elusive herein we aimed to investigate the correlation between the airway microbiome changes and immune response in pneumonia patients
methods we performed metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing on balf blood sputum and swab samples from immunocompetent ico and immunocompromised ich pneumonia patients shannon index and richness were used to evaluate alphadiversity for betadiversity analysis the principal coordinate analysis scaling plot and nonmetric multidimensional scaling were applied differentially expressed genes degs were determined and enriched by encyclopedia of genes and genomes pathway enrichment analysis finally sparcc algorithm was used for constructing microbial and host cooccurrence patterns
results compared to ico patients with pneumonia ich patients had higher pneumonia severity index psi score and showed higher microbial diversity in balf but less diversity in sputum besides pneumonia patients with different immune status ich or ico and different psi scores exhibited much different composition and betadiversity in rt samples additionally ebv abundance was positively correlated with psi score and detection of ebv associated to increased disease severity  moreover a total of 801 degs and 26 immune related genes irgs and 11 interferon stimulated genes isgs were identified between ebv detected and ebv notdetected balf samples these degs were enriched in signaling pathways related to immune response and viral infection such as p53 and tgfbeta further cooccurrence network illustrated that these irgs especially egfr and cxcl17 exhibited remarkable interactions to common respiratory microbial species 
conclusion pneumonia patients with different disease severity may exert distinct microbial composition and diversity notably ebv would serve as a microbial signature for disease severity via regulating hosts immune response which in turn could alter microbial compositions",1

"text","utilization of feces has long been a popular approach for genetic and ecological studies of wildlife however the success of molecular marker genotyping and genome resequencing is often unpredictable due to insufficient enrichment of endogenous dna in the total fecal dna that is dominated by bacterial dnas here we report a simple and cheap method named peers to predominantly crack animal cells over bacteria by using sodium dodecyl sulfate sds to discharge endogenous dna into liquid phase by brief centrifugation the supernatant is available for dna extraction using routine methods our assessments showed the endogenous dna was significantly enriched for all fecal samples of carnivorous omnivorous and herbivorous mammals and the success of genetic marker genotyping and whole genome resequencing were significantly improved although the enrichment and success vary with the quality storage methods and time of fecal samples we also provide methods and models to assess the enrichment efficiency of both nuclear and mitochondrial dna and predict the usability of such dna for routine genotyping and next generation sequencing this method requires less than 10 min treatment prior to routine extraction and only additional cost of  01 per sample but offers more promised outcomes of fecal dnabased experiments in wildlife studies",1

model animals play a very important role in various scientific research fields and the study of gut microbiota also requires the assistance of model animal microbiota mice and rats as the most common model animals used in the study of symbiotic microorganisms are used as construction vectors for various disease models is there any other construction vector that is more suitable as a model for a certain disease that can be applied to the study of gut microbiota in this project we will explore new disease models that can be applied to the study of gut microbiota
the study of coronary heart disease also relies on the establishment of animal models conventional animal models of coronary heart disease cannot fully reproduce the clinical phenotype of coronary heart disease however some studies have found that hamsters have similar lipid metabolism and arteriosclerosis characteristics to humans making them advantageous model animals for human cardiovascular disease research in order to explore the relationship between coronary heart disease and gut microbiota it is crucial to study the metagenomics of hamster gut microbiota this study aims to construct a genomic collection of hamster gut microbiota by sampling the feces of hamsters of different ages breeds regions genders and genotypes revealing the factors affecting changes in hamster gut microbiota and the impact of ldlr gene knockout on gut microbiota in combination with the research progress of predecessors and the research group the research group proposed that the host gene mutation and food changes led to changes in the intestinal flora which determined the occurrence of different diseases based on the research results and scientific facts of different disease models such as diabetes and coronary heart disease induced by high sugar and highfat diet based on the ldl receptor knockout hamsters and the interaction between the host ldlr gene mutation and the bodys intestinal flora affected the occurrence and development of coronary heart disease the theoretical hypothesis is that changes in gut microbiota are a key factor in the occurrence and development of coronary heart disease however the validity of this theoretical hypothesis requires animal models to conduct in vivo experimental verification and the causal relationship between changes in gut microbiota and the occurrence and development of coronary heart disease needs to be established",1
