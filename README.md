# Improve Generic Resource Type Classification

This is a COMET enrichment and curation workflow pilot project. Go to the [Pilot Projects Overview Board](https://github.com/orgs/cometadata/projects/14) to see all of the pilots.  

## Objective

To develop and evaluate methods for assigning more granular resource types (e.g., JournalArticle, Preprint, Report, BookChapter, Dissertation) to the ~25 million works currently classified only with the generic type Text in DataCite metadata.

## Getting Involved 

COMET is in the process of setting up a Github space for ideas and feedback from the COMET community. In the meantime, get involved by: 
* providing input on the project at [the pilot project epic](https://github.com/cometadata/improve-generic-resource-type-classifications/issues/13)
* viewing the project's progress at the [Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/cometadata/projects/9)
* contributing topics about this pilot by opening an issue in this repo, or
